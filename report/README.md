 - target audience is the professor
 - in-depth discussion of the theory and derivation of key results, and the tables, plots, and other relevant results generated by your software implementation that reproduce the original work
 - should follow loosely the same structure of the original paper, but be expressed in your own words.

It should also contain:
 - rationale for choice of programming framework
 - a discussion of any issues encountered that affected reproducibility
 - not be graded on how close your results are, but rather, how close your results are to what the paper intended to show, as a function of the information that was available to you. 
 - A critical analysis of how reproducible the work is, and what your group's thought process was for handling ambiguities, is therefore an important component of the report
